          <h1>Steps for Adding &amp; Editing a  Daily Sheet:</h1>
  <p class="deletebuttonalt">Step 1: Add All Employees &amp; Employee Daily Time First</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Add all employees on the crew, including the crew leader to  the daily sheet <em><strong>first</strong></em><strong></strong>&nbsp;by using the &quot;Add employee&quot; link. </li>
              <li>After all of the employees are added to the daily sheet, edit  each employee's time by clicking on the pencil next to each employee's name.</li>
              <li>At the &quot;Employee Time Editor&quot; page, enter the  employee time in segments. <br />
              For example: enter the morning time 6:00 AM - 11:30  AM&nbsp;for the first row and then <br />
              Add another row and enter 12:00 PM - 5:00 PM  for the afternoon work time.</li>
              <li>After all of the employee daily time is entered, you can   start adding the day's jobs by choosing the &quot;Add a job&quot; icon.</li>
  </ol>
               <p class="deletebuttonalt">Step 2: Add All Jobs &amp; Lunch </p>
              <ol> <li>For best results, add each of the day's jobs <strong><em>first</em></strong> before  entering employee service time for each job.</li>
              <li>If lunch was taken while a job was in progress, you need to  choose &quot;Add Lunch to this Job&quot; and enter the Lunch Start Time and  Lunch End Time. <em>Only if lunch was taken while a job was in progress.</em></li>
              <li>Once all of the day's jobs and lunch have been entered, you  can  edit each employee's service time for each job by clicking on the pencil  next to each employee's name.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="deletebuttonalt">Step 3: Edit Employee Service Time</p>
                <ol>
              <li>Before editting employee service time please make sure that If lunch was taken while a job was in progress, you chose &quot;Add Lunch to this Job&quot; and entered the Lunch Start Time and  Lunch End Time. <em><br />
              Only if lunch was taken while a job was in progress.</em></li>
              <li>If all of the employees worked on a job and each did the  same service for the same amount of time you can select &quot;Use for all  Employees on the Job&quot; button.</li>
              <li>After you have entered employee service time for each job  and all crew members service time is accounted for&nbsp;on each job, you can   add the materials used for each job by selecting the &quot;Add Materials&quot;  link under each job.</li>
              <li>The final step is to review the daily sheet for accuracy.</li>
            </ol>
