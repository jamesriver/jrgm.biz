              <h2><u>ANNUAL GROUNDS MAINTENANCE PLAN</u></h2>
              <h3>I.  SEASONAL MAINTENANCE SERVICES</h3>
                Unless specified otherwise, basic grounds maintenance services will be performed weekly April through October and as needed in March and November. These basic services include policing, mowing and edging. Prior to mowing, all litter and miscellaneous debris, within reason, will be removed. Additional charges may apply for disposal of large amounts of debris. Mowing and trimming will not take place when turf is excessively wet or during severe drought when there is no evidence of new growth. Bed edging will be performed with each mowing to maintain a consistent delineation between turf and mulch areas. Blade edging of curbs and other paved areas will be performed every other mowing, unless specified otherwise. Upon completion of mowing and edging operations, all paved surfaces will be blown clean. Sidewalks, curbs, gutters and gravel areas will be treated with herbicide as needed to maintain a weed free condition. Treatment for crack weeds in large parking lots is not included, unless specified otherwise.
              <h3>II. BED  WEED CONTROL</h3>
                Unless specified otherwise, all tree, shrub and flower beds will be hand weeded and treated with pre and post emergent chemical applications as needed to maintain a neat appearance at all times. Treatment for certain weeds, specifically nut sedge, may require several applications of expensive chemicals to control, which will be done at an additional cost, upon the approval of the owner.
              <h3>III.  OFF SEASON SERVICES</h3>
              Unless specified otherwise, December through February, the grounds will be inspected and cleared of trash and debris on a bi-weekly basis. Unless specified otherwise, Leaf removal will be done in three major events that are performed between late October and January. All debris will be disposed of off-site unless otherwise agreed upon with client. Cleanup of any debris resulting from storms can be completed at an additional cost upon the approval of the client. Refer to "Attachment A&#8221; for the specific frequency. 
              <h3>IV.  TURF CARE PROGRAM</h3>
Unless otherwise specified, all designated turf areas will be treated with pre and post emergent weed control applications throughout the year to control common weeds like crabgrass, clover, chickweed, broadleaf plantain, dandelions, thistle, etc. Treatment for certain weeds, specifically nutsedge, Goosegrass, Johnson grass, Dallisgrass, Buttonweed, and wild violet, may require several applications of expensive chemicals to control, which will be done at an additional cost, upon the approval of the owner. Fertilizer will be applied throughout the year at a rate of at least one pound of actual nitrogen per 1,000 sq. ft. but not more than three pounds of actual nitrogen will be applied annually. Lime will be applied according to soil analysis recommendations up to a rate of 25 lbs. per 1,000 sq. ft. A qualified James River employee, following all applicable laws and licensing requirements, will perform all turf applications. Refer to &#8220;Attachment A&#8221; for the specified frequency. Fescue turf will be core aerated and over seeded at a rate of 4 lbs. per 1,000 sq. ft. in fall. Bermuda turf will be aerated in summer to promote growth but will not be over seeded unless fall rye is specifically requested and detailed on &#8220;Attachment A&#8221;. Unless specified otherwise, fungicide and insecticide applications are not included and will be performed at an additional cost, upon approval of owner.
              <h3>V. TREE  AND SHRUB CARE</h3>
Unless specified otherwise, trees under 15&#8217; in height will be inspected annually, while dormant. If lower limbs are found to be dead, diseased or damaged, they will be removed at that time.  Low hanging branches will be removed up to a 7ft height from all trees as needed to keep parking and pedestrian areas free from obstructions. Unless specifically requested by the owner, Crape Myrtles will be pruned as outlined above. Crape Myrtle crown reduction promotes excessive sprouting and weak limb connections and is not standard practice of the Contractor. Shrubbery pruning will be done periodically throughout the year to maintain a neat appearance with respect to the intended growth patterns of the plants. Refer to &#8220;Attachment A&#8221; for the specific frequency. This contract does not include rejuvenation or corrective pruning, storm damage or pruning in a matter that is not keeping with the natural growth pattern of the plants. If desired, such pruning can be can be done at an additional cost by the owner. Liriope, daylilies and other miscellaneous grasses and perennials will be cut back in the winter or early spring.

              <h3>VI. HORTICULTURAL  CARE PROGRAM</h3>
Unless specified otherwise, ornamental trees and shrubs will be fertilized one time per year with a slow- release granular fertilizer. Deep root fertilization of trees and large shrubs is not included and will be performed at an additional cost, upon approval of owner. The Contractor is responsible for the monitoring and detection of plant damaging insects and diseases. Proactive and reactive measures will be used to control typical insect infestations like azalea lace bug, aphids and bagworms. Control for certain infestations such as scale, gypsy bug and Japanese beetle may require several applications and will be performed at an additional cost, upon approval of owner. Unless specified otherwise, fungicide and disease control applications are not included and will be performed at an additional cost, upon approval of owner.

              <h3>VII.  MULCH</h3>
Unless specified otherwise, previously mulched areas will be mulched in the spring with shredded hardwood mulch at a consistent 2&#8221; depth. If a second mulch is included, it will be done in the winter at a 1&#8221; depth. Refer to &#8220;Attachment A&#8221; for the specific frequency. All mulch is of the highest quality material but cannot be certified pest-free. Dyed or non-dyed material may be used. Refer to &#8220;Attachment A&#8221; for the specific material. Prior to mulching, existing bed lines will be redefined with a spade shovel and/or trenching machine at a right angle to a consistent depth of 3&#8221;. Removal of old mulch and/or turning of mulch are not included, but may be performed at an additional cost. 

              <h3>VIII.  SEASONAL PLANTINGS</h3>
Typically two times per year, in spring and fall, six-inch potted annuals are planted 8-12&#8221; on center to fill existing flowerbeds. Refer to &#8220;Attachment A&#8221; for the specific frequency and quantity. Flowers are mulched, fertilized and watered upon installation. If no irrigation system is present, continual hand watering is not the responsibility of the Contractor. The Contractor will not replace plants that die from lack of water. The owner will be given the opportunity to participate in the selection of type and color of flowers to be planted.                
                
              <h3>IX.  IRRIGATION SERVICES</h3>
If the property has a functioning irrigation system, the Contractor has the ability to perform the following services as part of a grounds contract: 
        <ol>
          <li>A <u>Spring Start-up</u> of your system will be complete by May 1. At this time, JRGM will install the backflow preventer to the system if removed at winterization, turn on the water and pressurize the main line, and check the main line and backflow preventer (and pump if applicable) for leaks. We will also activate each zone that can be operated from the controller(s) and check for proper operation and adjustment. We will then adjust any heads for peak capability. If the battery in the controller(s) requires replacing we will do so. Program watering schedule(s) of all properly operating zones, based on existing weather conditions. All problems will be noted and an estimated price will be given to client to complete those tasks. </li>
                <li>During the growing season, our irrigation staff will complete <u>X</u> number of <u>Inspections</u> of your system. Between three (bimonthly) and six (monthly) are recommended annually. An inspection consists of activating each zone that can be operated from the controller(s) and checking for proper operation and coverage. Adjustments will be made to heads for maximum efficiency and flags will be placed at locations of any heads in need of repair. The water schedule will be updated to ensure all zones are operating properly based on prevailing weather conditions. A summary of any issues found during the inspection will be created along with estimated costs to repair them and will be sent to customer.</li>
                <li><u>Winterization</u> will take place no later than November 30. During this task the entire system will be purged of water using compressed air. The controller will also be shut down.<u></u></li>
                <li>An annual <u>Backflow Inspection</u> can be included if the locality where the property is located requires one. The backflow inspection is important because it prevents contaminated water from flowing back into your potable water - a serious health hazard.<u></u></li>
        </ol>
        <p><span class="caps"><em><u>Repairs are not included in the price of the contract as there is no way to estimate what repairs will be necessary any given year. Repairs can be completed at $75.00 per hour, with a one-hour minimum. This figure does not include materials.</u></em></span></p>
